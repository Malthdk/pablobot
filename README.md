## Idea

The idea of this is to make a server that uses a cron job to daily generate art related to the weather forecast. It does so by using a web scraper to get weather forecast, then uses gpt to generate a prompt from that, then uses dalle 3 to generate the image and send it via Telegram.

## Development

Run as a normal nodejs script!!
